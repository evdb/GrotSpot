PRE LAUNCH:

    reveal maps and location info

    capture email address and store

    seeing duplicates - is it our random code?

LATER:

    make the next box big enough to cover the original rating boxes

    smarts so that people can't choose their own locations to rate
    
    browse ratings on a map
    
    add more cities
    
    big map to select city to do ratings in

    expand the panorama and float the rating buttons over it?
    
    add timestamps to rows in db
